# GLAB 330.2.2 – Standard Deviation

## Overview
This project demonstrates how to calculate the standard deviation for the given dataset. Standard deviation measures how spread out values are from the mean.

## Dataset
2, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 7, 9

## Steps Taken
1. Calculated the mean  
2. Computed each value’s squared deviation  
3. Found the variance  
4. Took the square root to get the standard deviation  

## Final Answer
**Standard Deviation = 2**
