"# HashiraDataSlayers" 
I am hoping that I build skills in Data Analytics to bridge the gap with my product support experience in hopes of become a product analyst, data analyst, BI analyst and then eventually an associate product manager. 
I believe this course will help me learn the basics and gain hands on experience to utlize in the real world.
